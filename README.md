## Overview
Stompbox is an effects pedal listing site, where sellers can create an account and list their pedals for sale.  Potential buyers can browse pedals by category and contact sellers for more information or to complete a private sale, much like Gumtree.  The site provides CRUD functionality to sellers for their account and listings.

This website was built with the Django framework, PostgreSQL and Python for the back-end and HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap for the front-end.  This is my fourth project as part of Code Institute's Full-Stack Software Development course.

## User Experience (UX)

### Objective

To provide a marketplace for sellers and buyers of used effects pedals.  The aim is to provide an intuitive website for sellers to create an account and list a pedal and also be an enjoyable experience for buyers to browse and buy pedals.
